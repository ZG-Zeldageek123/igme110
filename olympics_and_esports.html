    <p>With the growing popularity of eSports, one might ask- will there ever be an Olympics-style event for eSports?
        Will professional gamers one day stand on stage with the gold, silver, and bronze medals of tradition and 
        represent their countries with pride? While the notion may have been a fairy-tale ten years ago, it now 
        presents itself as a possible reality what with growing eSports popularity among the populace and an 
        increase in the industry's value. As of 2019, there has already been an attempt at an eSports-like event 
        called "e-Games" that debuted at the Rio 2016 Olympics. Unfortunately, e-Games seems to have abandoned its 
        initiative.

        <p>Fortunately, though, another initiative is being taken toward Olympic-like eSports recognition at the 
            prestigious, long-running Asian Games, which serves as an international Olympic-like event for Asian 
            countries run by the Olympic council itself. Some eSports will reportedly be represented at the 2022 
            Asian Games as official medal sports!

            An exhibition was held at the 2018 Asian Games, where League of Legends, Starcraft II, Hearthstone, 
            Pro Evolution Soccer, Clash Royale, and Arena of Valor were included as events. Expect these titles 
            and more at the 2022 Asian Games, and then hopefully the Olympics!
