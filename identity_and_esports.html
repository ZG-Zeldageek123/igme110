    <p>Fighting game phenomenon SonicFox is well-known throughout the fighting game community (FGC) and beyond, 
        but not just because he's one of the best competitive FGC players on the planet. Anything but shy about 
        their queer identity as a non-binary, bisexual individual, SonicFox serves as a beacon of hope and inspiration
        for queer eSports competitors across the globe. Because of the influence of people like SonicFox on the 
        eSports community as a whole, competitors find that they can be much more expressive about their identities.
        In the end, what matters is a person's skill - not what makes them different. eSports, as such, can serve as 
        an outlet for many to truly express themselves.

        If you'd like to see an interview with SonicFox that touches on this subject, check out

    <p>In a different way, competitive Smash Bros. Champion ZeRo encourages competitors to 
        be their best selves, challenging them to work hard in attaining their dreams despite the 
        resources that one ends up with in life. Community figureheads like ZeRo thus serve as 
        positive influences on young competitors, encouraging all to strive for mastery, self-acceptance, 
        and self-discipline.

        Nowadays, ZeRo no longer competes and spends his days creating content 
        related to Smash, since that pays more than actual tournament winnings.
