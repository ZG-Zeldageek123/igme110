    <p>RIT eSports, unlike many other college eSports organizations, prides itself on the fact that its 
        production quality, level of prestige, and overall demeanor mimicks that of a professional eSports team.
        Here at RIT, we are fortunate to have a faculty and institute-supported collegiate eSports organization 
        taken just as seriously as the traditional collegiate sports on campus. If eSports and competitive gaming
        in your college career is important to you as an individual, look no further than an education at RIT.
