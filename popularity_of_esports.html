        With younger generations, eSports is tremendously popular. Nowadays, children look up not to sports 
        stars as their heroes, but to streamers, eSports competitors, and content creators. As time goes on, 
        children increasingly grow up with controllers in hand as opposed to sports gear, and thus find eSports 
        and competitive gaming to be highly relatable. One study estimated that 56% of individuals aged 14-21 
        watch competitive gaming content, with many of them playing those games as well. Compare this to the 
        estimated 16% of adults that watch eSports content and the trend of popularity among the young becomes clear.

        Perhaps one of the biggest examples of the youth's increasing interest in eSports is the Fortnite 
        phenomenon. Children across the globe know, play, and watch competitive Fortnite because it is a 
        free-to-play battle royale game that gained a lot of traction in media and in YouTube content geared 
        toward children. Its popularity has helped grow the eSports industry even further, and help break it 
        into the mainstream media frequently. As time goes on and our youth grows up, expect increased coverage 
        of and interest in competitive video games.
